🌤️ Good News: Massive Turnout for the “No Kings” Protest

The turnout for the No Kings protests was historic. Organizers are estimating almost 7 million 
participants nationwide which is staggering. Even the more conservative analysis by data 
journalist G. Elliot Morris places it between 5 and 6.5 million.

Either way, even low end estimates would make it 
the largest single-day political protest in U.S. history.

It’s been awesome seeing all the photos here, and all across the other regions so thank you 
to everyone who participated. 

Predictably, there's a MAGA conspiracy going around pushing nonsense claims that MSNBC used 
fake protest photos from Boston. Probably stems from the reality that millions of Americans 
showed up, the most in history, to protest their "god emperor king", is something they 
refuse to accept.

You can point to the article above to debunk their claims, or just let them cope. 
As the real patriots, we’ll keep showing up.

🧠 Talking Point of the Week: “How Is Trump a King if He Was Elected?”

You’ve probably seen this one — Meghan McCain and others posting some version of:

“How can Trump be a king if he was fairly elected?”

Here are some responses that get the point across fast:

Elections don’t make kings — behavior does. Plenty of tyrants started out by winning elections, 
then used power to dismantle accountability, and eventually rig the system to keep them in power.
    
Trump acts like laws don’t apply to him. He's constantly talking about how he deserves to run for 
a third term, and his administration is constantly breaking the Hatch Act. He also pardons allies 
who break the law (especially for him like with the J6ers).

He weaponizes agencies using the DOJ like a personal legal team and demanding that they go after 
his political enemies. He fires prosecutors who won't target his enemies, until he finds someone 
awful enough to do so. This is how he got the DOJ to bring cases against James Comey, 
Leticia James, and John Bolton, and less high profile people like Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve.

He’s trying to rule by decree. He has by far the greatest number of executive orders in history 
at this point in his presidency. These executive orders range from trying to end birthright 
citizenship to diverting congressionally-approved funds for social programs towards giving 
Argentina a 20 billion dollar bailout.
    
He guts oversight. He's fired countless inspectors general without cause or notice, the watchdogs 
meant to keep the government honest. He fired the head of the BLS for posting employment numbers
that showed a weaker economy than he claims, which is unprecedented. 
    
He treats loyalty as law, publicly threatening judges, attacking journalists, trying to get late 
night TV hosts fired, withholding funding from universities, banning law firms who had legal cases 
against him from the white house — pure strongman behavior.
    
He fantasizes about expansion and control, talking about “taking over” U.S. cities, and floating 
absurd ideas about invading Canada, Greenland and Panama. It’s delusional imperial cosplay, 
not leadership.
    
His own words betray him, quoting Napoleon with “He who saves his country does not violate any law.” 
That’s literally quoting a dictator's justification for his actions.

🕯️ Final Thought

The “No Kings” turnout proved something powerful — people are paying attention, and they will 
show up when it matters.  Now our job is to keep that energy alive between protests, one week
and one conversation at a time.

No kings. No crowns. Just us — we the people.
