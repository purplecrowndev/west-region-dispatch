Last edition came on the heels of a really dark moment in America’s history with the killing of Alex Pretti, so I want to start this one off a little lighter and hopeful.

### 🏈 Seahawks beat the Patriots, so America won

Congrats to Seattle. Since Sam Darnold is from SoCal, I will absolutely be claiming this as an LA championship by proxy. 

Also Bad Bunny’s halftime show was an unapologetically proud statement against the vision for America that the Trump administration is trying to put forth. Of course that led to it triggering the worst people in this country, including the president himself.

## 🗳️ Good News

We’re also seeing some incredible overperformance in special elections signaling huge momentum heading into the midterms. I know that there's a lot of horrific things going on in the country, but it's important to recognize wins as they happen instead of dooming, and in my opinion these are massive victories.

- Texas SD-9
    - Democrat Taylor Rehmet flipped a seat Trump won by 17
    - Won by double digits
    - Fort Worth’s largely Hispanic neighborhoods saw **swings of 50+ points** compared to 2024
- Louisiana HD-60
    - Democrat Chasity Verret Martinez defeated her Republican opponent by double digits
    - In an **R+13 district**
    - Huge **37% swing**

# 🏡 Local Updates

### LA Meetup

Went great! Shoutout to Omar for helping with outreach. Also a funny coincidence but Babooah was advertising free tickets to an abundance festival in LA that he was working at with Project Liberal as a sponsor. It just happened to be the very same event that Sam/Flowtrace flew in to LA for.

### Protesting TPUSA 

We phonebanked for Coos County Dems in Oregon to let people know about TPUSA entering local schools there. According to Nimblecivic, who was one of the organizers of the protest, they had 150–200 people show up!

# 📰 Contributors Wanted

I’m also looking to expand this newsletter with state contributors to have little news write ups for their states.

This week with Seattle's Super Bowl win, we appropriately have Rafi stepping up with a bunch of Washington news, and honestly going above and beyond. 

Would love to have more folks do the same for other states, but just want to emphasize, if you want to become a contributor for your state, I don't expect all this research! So if you want to send in quick updates from your state, even just a short paragraph, let me know!

# Washington News

# [WA Senate OKs guardrails for license plate readers](https://washingtonstatestandard.com/2026/02/04/wa-senate-oks-guardrails-for-license-plate-readers/) 

- With a vote of 40-9 vote with only Republicans opposing, the Senate passed a bill to regulate the use of automated license plate readers amid concerns of federal immigration agents accessing data the devices collect.
- An October report out of the University of Washington found multiple police departments authorized U.S Border Patrol to use their license plate reader databases. Other cases found that Border patrol had backdoor access without express permission, and in other instances, police conducted searches on behalf of the Feds
- Under [Senate Bill 6002](https://app.leg.wa.gov/billsummary/?BillNumber=6002&Year=2025&Initiative=false) reader data would have to be deleted within 21 days, unless it's needed for police evidence. It would prohibit police from sharing information except for court proceedings, with some exceptions. The readers would not be allowed to be used for civil immigration enforcement, or to be deployed near schools, churches, or food banks. Law enforcement must also keep logs of when their reader data was accessed for five years. The legislation allows for police to use the readers only to compare the data to watch lists for stolen vehicles. missing or endangered persons, vehicle registered to people with felony warrants and investigations related to vehicles at weigh stations

# [WA Senate leader explains dim outlook for a new tax on big businesses](https://washingtonstatestandard.com/2026/02/03/top-lawmaker-in-wa-senate-on-why-a-plan-to-tax-big-businesses-is-likely-doomed/) 

- A year ago Sen. Jamie Pedersen signed onto legislation to create a statewide version of a Seattle tax on the payrolls of Washington's largest employers.
- Failing to gain traction, the legislature settled on other means of raising $9 billion taxes from businesses over four years to bridge an operating gap
- This year, Pedersen signaled that the payroll tax is a non started due to the lack of votes, instead he authored an income tax on households earning over $1 million in a year
- Democratic Socialist Rep.Shaun Scott has become the driving force pushing this legislation to the public
- Pro-Tax activists are frustrated at the lack of interest in the payroll tax from Dem leaders and Gov. Bob Ferguson, they suspect: That corporate interests won’t fight the “millionaire’s tax” as long as the payroll levy — which business leaders detest — doesn’t move.
- Their argument for the tax is: Washington faces a budget challenge with a slowing economy and expected increased demand for services due to changes in federal law. Payroll tax proponents argue that the tax can raise money quickly to solve these pressures, whereas the income tax will take years to implement.
- Pedersen's rebuttal to the claim that the payroll tax would produce revenue faster than the income tax was: That is a falsehood that is coming from certain people who want to make people believe that there’s not a problem in the current budget that we can solve with additional revenue. Both of them could go into effect in 2028.

# [The Bills that didn't survive the WA Legislature's first major deadline](https://washingtonstatestandard.com/2026/02/05/the-bills-that-didnt-survive-the-wa-legislatures-first-major-deadline/) 

- This legislative session was only 60 days and many bills failed to pass the first major deadline. Even bills that passed the first hurdle can still die, if a bill costs money, they have to advance past another committee by the end of Monday Feb 9. They'll then have to pass out of the Chamber they originated in by Feb 17.
- Bills that died which I personally loved were [House Bill 2611](https://app.leg.wa.gov/BillSummary/?BillNumber=2611&Year=2025&Initiative=false) which calls for a 4 day work week and [House bill 2648] Which would have prohibited local law enforcement agencies from hiring previous ICE agents. Some online protection bills for children were also introduced but failed to survive, [Senate bill 6111](https://app.leg.wa.gov/BillSummary/?BillNumber=6111&Year=2025&Initiative=false) would have required parental consent for minors under 17 to create a social media account, and [House Bill 2400](https://app.leg.wa.gov/BillSummary/?BillNumber=2400&Year=2025&Initiative=false) which would have aimed to set up safeguards for children who appear in monetized online content, such as family blogs. Some Tribal Representation bills were also introduced but ultimately died, [House Bill 2578](https://app.leg.wa.gov/billsummary/?BillNumber=2578&Year=2025&Initiative=false) would have added four tribal members to the nine-member Fish and Wildlife Commission, the governor would appoint eight indigenous people in total, with two members from east of the Cascades, two from Western Washington, and four alternates.

# [Washington Tribes could get more say in management of state logging lands](https://washingtonstatestandard.com/2026/02/06/washington-tribes-could-get-more-say-in-management-of-state-logging-land/) 

- Sen. Claudia Kauffman, a Democrat from Kent who's the first Native American woman to serve in the State Senate, introduced [Senate Bill 5838](https://app.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=5838&Year=2025&Initiative=False) the bill called originally for only one tribal representative to be appointed to the board, but it was changed to two as it moved through the committee process.
- This proposal is backed by Public Lands Commissioner Dave Upthegrove, who chairs the board and leads the Department of Natural Resources. The department itself requested this legislation.
- If signed, the governor would appoint a tribal representative from each side of the Cascades, expanding membership from six to eight. Eligible tribal members must hold an elected position in a federally recognized tribe whose reservation or treaty-ceded lands are in state.
- The Board approves timber sales, manages conservation land, established sustainable forest harvest levels and oversees the sale and exchange of state trust land. The boards decisions guides the work of the state DNR, which manages about 6 million acres of public land.
- Critics of the proposal argue that tribal members would sway the board away from their timber sales that benefit counties and public schools, “I’ve got timber mills that rely on jobs and children who rely on the food that comes from their parents having jobs in those mills,” said Sen. Keith Wagoner, R-Sedro Woolley. “You can understand my reticence to put somebody there who might be voting against my district’s interest.” Wagoner’s concern partially stems from the commissioner’s directive to [preserve about 77,000 acres of forests](https://washingtonstatestandard.com/2025/08/26/wa-lands-commissioner-orders-77000-acres-of-older-state-forests-to-be-conserved/), he noted.
- Supporter argued “I would not presume how any individual would vote,” Upthegrove said during a hearing, responding to Wagoner. “We have timber tribes, non-timber tribes. We have a lot of diversity of views in tribal government.”

# [Seattle Poised to Remove SEPA Review Hurdle for Most Housing Projects](https://www.theurbanist.org/2026/02/07/seattle-poised-to-remove-sepa-review-hurdle-for-most-housing-projects/) 

- Several months after the expiration of a two-year environmental review holiday for residential and mixed-use projects under the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA), The Seattle city council [advanced legislation](https://seattle.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=7699273&GUID=E993C2BF-42BB-4986-AACF-B443822DE09D&Options=&Search=) to make the exemptions permanent and significantly limit SEPA for commercial developments. Legislation passed out of the Land Use and Sustainability Committee with a "Do pass" Recommendation on Wednesday, and heads to the full council meeting on Tuesday, Feb 10.
- City council member Alexis Mercedes Rinck introduced an amendment which targets parking garages and paid parking lots, saying, “The reason I’m bringing this amendment forward is to ensure our environmental goals aren’t being put aside to promote more parking without proper review...Our city’s biggest source of emissions comes from transportation, and single occupancy vehicles are a large share of that — they’re the culprit. And I want to be clear that I support this legislation holistically, because exempting housing from SEPA just simply makes sense. That’s because we know when we build more housing — and we’re building in Seattle — the environment is better off because we’re reducing sprawl and reliance on cars, but I don’t believe we should be clearing the way for more parking, especially flexible use parking, to exempt from environmental review.” the amendment passed on a 4-0 vote, lowering the threshold for the SEPA exemption in all non-industrial areas of city from 40 stalls down to 20 stalls of “flexible use” parking, which is the City’s term for paid parking that is open to the public, rather than resident-only parking which wouldn’t trigger SEPA review.
