In honor of Trump delivering the longest State of the Union speech in history, this edition of the dispatch will also be very long, but instead of being filled with outlandish claims, it'll be filled with useful information instead thanks to some extra contributors from the West Region this week. We had one other not be able to finish their article by this edition, but there's a good chance we'll have it ready by the next edition. But make sure to check out the CTA by "Final Winglet Boss" towards the end if you don't have time to read anything else!

## First things first

Mentioning this first because it was the most exciting thing for me personally (and logically has to be the same for everyone else :P) but we are now a 501 (c)(4)! We can now say officially that we have a bank account to rake in them dollars to fund our org !!!!!!!!

## 📊 Polling Context Heading Into the SOTU

While we're on the topic of the SOTU from the intro, I want to point to some crazy [numbers from a CNN/SSRS poll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZXEMt1KWP8) conducted from Feb 17th to Feb 20th:

- **Approval amongst Latino voters**
    - February 2025: **41% approval** of Trump
    - Now: **22% approval** 
- **Approval amongst Independents**
    - Post–January 6, 2021: **32%**
    - Now: **26%**
    - This one I thought was particulary crazy. His approval amongst independents is lower than it was right after January 6th
- **Net Approval (approval minus disapproval) amongst Independents**
    - February 2025: **–13**
    - Now: **–47**

I've gotten into some debates on the whether these polls even matter, but I'm going to continue to go to bat for them. Unpopularity reduces fear. When an administration is unpopular, people are less afraid to protest. Whistleblowers, judges, civile servants, and institutions feel less fear to do what's right. Public dissent literally gives other people more courage and in turn makes us all socially safer. Unpopularity is a check on abuse. It won't completely remove abuses but everything is a matter or degree. We all need to make sure that everyone realizes how fucking awful Trump and his administration is for the country,

## 📣 RUN FOR THESE ROLES
  
During our last meeting, we talked about encouraging people to run for Precinct Committee Officer (PCO) and State Delegate roles as one of the highest bang for your buck ways to get involved in Democratic politics in terms of time committment and impact.

---
## 🏘️ Precinct Committee Officer (PCO) Roles**
  
A **PCO represents Democrats in your local precinct**, which is the smallest voting unit.

PCOs typically:
- Vote on **local party leadership**
- Help shape **party rules and priorities**
- Assist with organizing, canvassing, and turnout
- Serve as a bridge between voters and the party
  
**Why it's worth applying::**
- Turnout for PCO races is extremely low
- Many seats go completely uncontested
- You can win with a handful of votes or be appointed if a seat is vacant

In most states, PCOs are elected during the primary with no one running opposed or appointed by the local party if no one runs
---

## **🏛️ State Delegates**

This role might be more sexy as they have a larger area of influence. State delegates attend **state party conventions or caucuses** and at those conventions delegates vote on:

- State party leadership
- Party rules and bylaws
- Party platform language
- Sometimes endorsements
- In presidential years, they chose the national delegates for the national convention.
    
---

## **🇺🇸  State Delegates vs National Delegates**

This might be a point of confusion (it was for me) but state delegates are not the same as the national delegates that get sent to the DNC when we nominate presidential candidates:

- **State delegates**
    - Work inside the state party
    - Attend state conventions
    - Help shape rules, leadership, and platforms for their state
    - Often help select nationoal delegates for the Democratic National Convention in presidential years
        
- **National delegates**
    - Attend the Democratic National Convention
    - Usually vote to confirm the winner of their state’s presidential primary
    - Are mostly bound to vote for whoever wins their state primary/caucuse (although technically they can chose not to)
  
National delegates are **usually a rubber stamp** for the primary winner but when there is no majority, that's when the fabled "contested convention" happens which is every political journalists's wet dream. The last time it happened was in 1968 which was chaotic and because of that state parties have instituted rules so that it doesn't happen again.

But state delegates can still have a big influence because:

- They help decide _who_ becomes a national delegates
- Who in turn determine national party platforms
- Which in turn shape the internal culture and direction of the party

---

## 🗂️ Conventions and Caucuses  

While rules vary by state, the process is usally pretty simple:
1. People run for **PCO** or attend local caucuses
2. PCOs and caucus attendees elect **state delegates**
3. State delegates attend the **state convention**
4. State conventions:
    - Elect leadership
    - Set rules and platform
    - Influence national delegate selection
    - State delegates and PCOs are often easy to win
	    - They run UNOPPOSED most times
	    - If you attend the convenction/caucuse and put a btd in to run, you have a big chance of winning

---

## **Why this holds a lot of "bang for your buck"**

Running for PCO or becoming a state delegate:
- Requires relatively little time
- Has outsized influence as you'll be giving input to your state pary
- Gives you voting power inside the party
- Builds organizing credibility if you choose to network

---

## 📣 Call to Action 


If you're interested in running for one of these roles:
- Look up **“Precinct Committee Officer" in your state**
- Check your **state or county Democratic Party website**
- Ask in the server as others may already know deadlines or rules

ALERT: Defend Our Water – Protect Our Health
A Call to Action for the 2026 EPA Fluoride Re-evaluation
1. What is the 2026 EPA Re-evaluation?
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has launched an accelerated, high-priority review of fluoride in our drinking water. While these reviews usually happen every six years, a 2024 federal court ruling (Food & Water Watch, Inc. v. EPA) and pressure from the new administration have forced the EPA to fast-track its analysis of whether current fluoride levels pose an "unreasonable risk" to human health.
2. Why is RFK Jr. Driving This?
As Secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has made the removal of fluoride from public water a "Day One" priority of the MAHA (Make America Healthy Again) movement.
The Claim: He has labeled fluoride as "industrial waste" and a "dangerous neurotoxin."
The Goal: Kennedy is directing the CDC to stop recommending fluoridation and is working "in lockstep" with the EPA to rewrite federal safety standards.
3. The Risk: Biased Science vs. Public Health
There is a growing concern that this review may prioritize biased, non-peer-reviewed studies over decades of "Gold Standard" dental research.
The Threat: If the EPA ignores the well-documented benefits of fluoride and over-weights outlier studies, they may remove the federal recommendation entirely.
The Impact: This would leave local water boards (like Parker Water & Sanitation) without federal guidance, making it easier for political groups to force fluoride out of your local pipes.
4. The Consequences: Health Spikes and Hidden Costs
When cities stop fluoridating, the results are immediate and expensive:
Health Crisis: In cities like Calgary and Windsor, removing fluoride led to a 51% to 78% increase in dental surgeries and "urgent needs" for children.
Financial Burden: While a city might save a few thousand dollars on chemicals, the public cost for emergency dental care and Medicaid treatments spikes by millions.
Equity Gap: Families who cannot afford private dental care or expensive supplements are hit the hardest.

CALL TO ACTION: MAKE YOUR VOICE HEARD
The EPA is accepting public comments on their Preliminary Assessment Plan UNTIL FEBRUARY 27, 2026.
How to Comment:

Re: Docket ID No. EPA-HQ-OW-2025-3823

I am writing as a resident of [Your City, State] to urge the EPA to ensure its 2026 Fluoride Toxicity Assessment is based strictly on reproducible, peer-reviewed, Gold Standard science. It is critical that the EPA does not ignore the decades of research proving that 0.7 mg/L is a safe and effective level for preventing dental disease. I am concerned that an ideological re-evaluation could lead to the removal of this vital public health measure, which would disproportionately harm low-income families and children in my community.
Please prioritize the inclusion of studies that reflect U.S. fluoridation levels and exclude biased or non-peer-reviewed data that contradicts the consensus of the American Dental Association and the CDC.

## From Rafi with more Washington News here:

### Washington News 2026 Week 2

After Loss of tax credits, WA sees a drop in insurance coverage 

About 19,000 fewer Washingtonians enrolled in health insurance through the state's online marketplace amid the loss of federal subsidies, although the decline is not as precipitous as feared. State officials had predicted 80,00 people would forgo coverage if congress didn't extend the enhanced premium tax credits for those purchasing the policies. Officials fear the drop could get steeper in the coming months as enrollees fail to pay premiums
During open enrollment, which ran from Nov. 1 to Jan. 15, more than 290,000 residents signed up for insurance through the Washington Health Benefit Exchange. That's compared to 309,000 during this period of the previous year. Exchange CEO Ingrid Ulrey said the drop in coverage, “could’ve been much worse,” but cautioned it’s still a “pretty significant dip from last year. We’re starting from a lower peak and we’re going to go down further than we have in the past,” Ulrey added. “People are going to see their bills and just say ‘I can’t do this.’”

Across the Nation, about 1.2 million fewer Americans signed up for marketplace coverage than in the previous year. State officials say Washington's efforts, including Cascade Care Savings for people who make up to 250% of the federal poverty line, helped mitigate the loss of the federal subsidies. More than 118,000 Washington Healthplanfinder customers are receiving this state premium assistance this year, up from 115,000 last year, according to the data released Friday, but the state says this assistance won't be sustainable beyond this year, especially as other federal health policy changes take effect.

"We're in jeopardy for 2027, '28, /29 and beyond" Ulrey said. "The hill we're climbing is only getting steeper." Rural counties, including Okanogan and Pacific, were hit hardest by the loss of federal tax credits. Premiums from individual insurance bought on the Washington Health Benefit Exchange rose and average of 21%, due in part to the loss of the enhanced tax credits. This increase is in line with similar hikes nationwide. People losing their enhanced tax credits could see monthly premiums double or triple. Lower income lawfully present immigrants, like refugees and asylees, saw their average monthly premiums rise from $25 to nearly $500, Ulrey said due to the "Big beautiful bill" prohibiting these non-citizens from accessing federal financial assistance for marketplace coverage.

Final enrollment figures are expected in the spring.
WA income tax on higher earners clears first legislative hurdle 

Senate Bill 6346 passed the Senate Ways and Means Committee on a voice vote, making the first legislative test of what is arguably the most divisive tax bill this session. Dubbed the "Millionaires tax" by its backers, it would impose a 9.9% levy on personal income over $1 million.
Republicans remained united in opposition with only one Democrat, Sen. Drew Hansen, of Bainbridge Island, voting against the bill, stating he wanted to see greater tax breaks for small businesses and individuals in the final version. The bill is headed to the Senate Rules Committee, where it is expected to be teed up for a vote by the full Senate in the next week.

Collection of the tax would start in 2029 and could total nearly $2.6 billion for the next budget, according to a fiscal analysis released Saturday Feb 7. When fully up and running, this tax is expected to generate $3.6 billion a year
The version of the bill passed by the committee differed from the original bill introduced last week by Senate Majority Leader Jamie Pedersen, D-Seattle, and co-sponsored by 25 Democrats. The amended version would hike the percentage of revenue for public defense services to 7% from 5%, this could produce more than $200 million annually to support local public defense systems across the state if income tax receipts achieve projections. New wording would also earmark 10% of the public defense money for cities and modify how dollars would be distributed to local governments with an emphasis on assisting rural counties where the challenge of providing counsel for those who cannot afford a lawyer is greatest. Another change to the income tax bill is the increase in tax breaks for smaller businesses, originally, the legislation called from exempting companies grossing less than $250,000 a year from paying the state's main business tax. That's double the current threshold. Pedersen's amendment would boost the level of the full exemption to $300,000 with companies enjoying partially reduced tax liability up to $600,000.
On Monday, Democrats reject all 11 Republican sponsored amendments. (based)

More dead bills stack up in WA legislature 
Monday was the cutoff for bills involving money to pass through fiscal committees, like Senate Ways and Means and House Appropriations, These panels held lengthy meetings that stretched throughout the day to pass dozens of bills and keep them alive. but, with another budget shortfall looming over the session, bills that cost to much money are having a difficult time. Days earlier, the first deadline of the session killed many other bills. More will stall on Feb. 17, the date to pass legislation out of the chamber of the Legislature where it originated. Further deadlines will follow before the session ends, scheduled for March 12.

Bills that "necessary to implement the budget," like those that include new taxes or otherwise bring in revenue for the state, are immune from the deadlines. Lawmakers can be creative in attaching this label.
Some of the bills that failed to pass this deadlines include House Bill 2559 which would have allowed cities and counties to impose a sales tax up to $4 on short-term rentals, House Bill 2481 which would have temporarily banned electronic pricing systems at retailers and prohibited surveillance or algorithmic surge pricing schemes, Senate Bill 5853 was a response to growing fears of violence against elected officials, after the killings last year of Charlie Kirk and Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman. The legislation would've created a statewide notification system to let public officials know of targeted threats to any elected leaders, Students pushed for Senate Bill 5826 that would have required the state's higher education institutions to offer medication abortion at their student health centers. if they don't have one, they would've needed to train staff to provide information and referral services...

Coal power in WA Legislature's cross-hairs after talk of Centralia plant's revival 
The Centralia power plant which was scheduled to shut down last year was forced to be kept open by the Trump administration. A bill the State House approved Thursday would impose hefty taxes and fees if it fires back up.

The Washington House of Representatives on Thursday approved a new coal tax that targets a single company, meant to thwart a surprise move by the Trump Regime to keep the last coal-fired power plant in the Pacific Northwest operational. The fast-moving bill would saddle TransAtla Corporation's Centralia coal plant with extra costs that would make it highly uncompetitive in the electricity marketplace were it to restart. TransAtla idled the power plant in December in conformance with a 2011 agreement to phase out coal power in Washington by the end of last year.
“This bill is intended to close the book on that chapter of our state’s electricity generation; to once and for all say we’re done generating electrons with the dirtiest and most expensive way to do so,” said House Majority Leader Joe Fitzgibbon, D-West Seattle, the lead sponsor. The vote in the Democratically-controlled House was 63 to 33. Many, but not all, Republicans voted no. The GOP’s representatives put up little fight on this issue, unlike the party’s feisty resistance to broader tax measures. The legislation now heads to the state Senate. An identical Senate version of the newly approved House bill – sponsored by Sen. Marko Liias, D-Edmonds – had no trouble passing out of committee last week.

The measure would apply a financial vise to coal power generation by removing tax and regulatory exemptions agreed to 15 years ago as part of the coal phaseout deal between TransAlta and the state. The state’s sales tax would be levied on coal deliveries. TransAlta would also have to purchase climate pollution allowances at the state’s periodic cap-and-trade auctions to cover emissions from burning coal. Until now, the company’s coal plant had an exemption based on the understanding that the independent energy generator would invest in pollution scrubbers and then spend millions of dollars on economic diversification initiatives in Lewis County. The cost of those carbon pollution allowances would be very high, given that coal has a much larger carbon footprint than the alternatives. For its part, TransAlta stayed quiet lately and seems to have decided its best strategy is to lie low. The company has long employed a blue-chip lobbying firm in Olympia, but they offered no written or spoken testimony to fend off the new tax and fees, according to legislative committee records. When asked for an update on its Centralia operations Thursday, a TransAlta spokesperson offered little: “We have no information to share at this time.” Leah Missik, legislative director for the environmental group Climate Solutions, speculated that TransAlta was ready to move past its coal generation era and proceed with a proposed conversion in Centralia to natural gas-fired electricity production. “They had a plan,” Missik said in an interview. “I don’t think they want to operate” the coal-fired boiler anymore.

### Washington News 2026 week 3

Tensions rising over how to spend revenue from proposed WA income tax 
A day after the Senate approved an income tax on millionaires, Gov. Bob Ferguson said he's still not satisfied with the bill, calling for tax relief on lower income families and small businesses. “This bill must be laser-focused on making life more affordable for Washingtonians and continuing to improve areas like K through 12 education,” the first-term Democrat said during a press conference Tuesday. “We are not there yet, and we are still not close to being there.”

The bill includes provisions to devote a sizable chunk of the resulting revenue to tax relief. It does not have a mechanism to lock in money for public schools, and Ferguson did not propose one. Two Democratic Senators who played key roles in pushing the bill through that chamber voiced skepticism about the governor's proposal. The Senate approved the bill Monday on a 27-22 vote, with three Democrats peeling off to the side with Republicans in opposition, assuming the house revises the bill, it would go back to the Senate for an up or down vote on the changes.
Top House lawmaker on tax issues hinted at frustration over how the governor has been sharing his priorities for the bill. “It’s unfortunate that he’d rather speak to us from a microphone, not a telephone,” Rep. April Berg, D-Mill Creek, who chairs the House Finance Committee, said as she stepped off the House floor en route to a Democratic caucus meeting. She declined to get into specifics of what the governor outlined during his press conference. “We have three weeks left. I need to get back to work,” she said.

In total Ferguson is asking for about $1.9 billion in tax relief by providing $1 billion in small business tax relief and said he wants the tax effectively wiped out for the first $2.5 million of businesses' total revenue, he also wanted to broaden eligibility for the working families tax credit and lift the value of the rebate by 20%. The tax credit goes to lower- and middle-income households and is currently between around $330 and #1,300 a year. 350,000 families now qualify and Ferguson said an additional 460,000 households would be eligible in this plan, another proposal Ferguson put forth was two sales tax holidays - one for two days and one for three.

'Absolutely good news': WA financial outlook brightens as budget talks heat up 
Washington budget writers are finally crying of joy at the first good news after a multi year deficit has haunted our state. Revenue collections are predicted to increase $827 million in the current two-year budget compared to expectations from November, according to a forecast from the state's Economic and Revenue Forecast Council. This 1.1% increase reflects early proceeds from the slate of tax increases the Legislature approved last year.
Monday's forecast means projected collections for the current biennium are up $483 million from the numbers lawmakers used to craft the state budget last spring. Revenue expectations are now at $75.3 billion, these are the final estimates lawmakers will get as they craft a supplemental budget, building off the $77.8 billion two-year spending plan they passed last year. Democrat's budget proposal is set to release Sunday. After budget legislation is released, lawmakers will have to hammer out further details and resolve differences between each chamber's version. The Legislative session is set to adjourn March 12.

Lawmakers are working off a framework Governor Ferguson announced in December in which he proposed tapping Washington's Rainy-day fund, cutting $800 million in spending and shifting %600 million from the state's carbon auctions to pay for tax credits for low and moderate-income families. He has been warning of a $2.3 billion budget hole that the state needed to fill some of that shortfall being made from cuts through the "Big, Bad Betrayal" bill Republicans passed through congress last year.

The governor’s budget director said, despite Monday’s good news, “We are still in a challenging period as costs to maintain current state service levels are increasing, as are caseloads for essential programs families rely on. But this forecast will hopefully relieve some pressure as the Legislature works to finalize and pass the supplemental budget,” K.D. Chapman-See said in a statement.

Ferguson proposed funding reductions for state services, including closing enrollment for the Working Connections Child Care program, cutting spending for the state’s higher education institutions and halting planned increases in state funding for struggling school districts. Environmentalists see the redirecting of Climate Commitment Act dollars as a de facto cut to climate spending.

More bills falter as time dwindles for Washington Legislature 
The third deadline for bills came this Tuesday in the Legislature. Killing multiple bills this session including priorities on issues like homelessness, child welfare, gun safety, and juvenile detention. Signaling a turning point in the Legislature's work, now lawmakers move back to House and Senate committee meetings on bills passed in the opposite chambers. The pressure isn’t letting up, as the next cutoff that could fell more bills is next Wednesday, when legislation needs to pass out of policy committees. Budget bills can remain in play past the deadlines. The session is set to end March 12.

The bills that dies during the cutoff are: House bill 2489 which would have barred local governments from enforcing laws banning 'life-sustaining activities', unless they can prove adequate shelter space is available for people to go. Senate bill 6308 which would have increased court oversight of Child Protective services cases involving children under age of 5 who are allowed to stay with their parents instead of being placed into foster care and Senate bill 6319 which looked to develop a community-based referral path to services for cases involving a child under age 4 and high-potency synthetic opioids, like fentanyl, both these bills aimed to address rising deaths and critical injuries in Washington's child welfare system. House bill 1824](https://app.leg.wa.gov/BillSummary/?BillNumber=1834&Chamber=House&Year=2025), requested by AG Nick Brown, aimed to protect youth by blocking social media companies from providing "addictive feeds" to minors. And companies also couldn't have sent push notifications to minors overnight or during school hours without parental consent, last year similar legislation passed the senate last year but stalled in the house, it suffered the same fate this session.

As the 5 p.m. cutoff to pass bills approached Tuesday, Sen. Shelly Short, R-Addy, launched an unusual bid to bog down the Senate process. She demanded Lt. Gov. Denny Heck, a Democrat, to have the chamber’s secretary read all 39 pages of a bill focused on electrical transmission infrastructure. Usually, the clerk reads the first and last line of legislation into the record. Heck agreed. This maneuver killed the transmission bill, as well as several others Senate Democrats were hoping to vote on before the deadline. One of those looked to address surging theft of copper wiring. Senate Bill 6190 would’ve imposed new recordkeeping requirements on scrap metal businesses and made destroying “critical communications infrastructure” a felony. Before the deadline, the bill’s sponsor, Sen. Tina Orwall, D-Des Moines, said she had her fingers crossed her measure would move forward. “There’s a lot of bills on the floor calendar, only so many can go,” she said. Orwall noted the issue is really affecting her district, which is now served by Sound Transit light rail. The train system is frequently targeted by wire thieves, including last week during the Seattle Seahawks’ Super Bowl victory parade. Orwall plans to bring back the legislation next year.
