It honestly feels like we were welcoming a couple hundred new people last week, and somehow this week there are even more new people joining this week. That’s really awesome so welcome (again) to everyone new!

For those of you reading for the first time, this is a biweekly (sometimes more) newsletter that gives server updates, as well as positive news to keep your morale up. As promised last week, here’s a summary of our most recent meeting, along with some other updates and good news.

## 🔁 Last Meeting Recap

### 📅 **2025 Year in Review**

We kicked things off by noting some of the stuff we did last year:

#### **Server-Wide Efforts**
- Lots of phonebanking activity including:
    - NC Supreme Court race ballot curing
    - Major 2025 races in Virginia and New Jersey
    - California’s Prop 50
- No Kings protests with strong turnout over both instances
- Community-building events that we still regularly conduct:
    - Game nights
    - Viewing parties
    - Monthly debate nights
        - Occasionally streamed on the DGG Events Kick channel with 300–400 viewers
#### **West Squad–Specific Highlights**
- **Washington Summit Pilot**, led by Jacob
    - Got WA folks touching grass so that they could meet face to face and build camaraderie
    - Snowy hike somewhere in the WA
    - They hope to hold more summits in the future 
- **LA Meetups for the DNC Youth Council Push**
    - The DNC met in LA over three days, so we had meetups across the same 3 days
    - Purpose: support three of our members running for seats on the DNC Youth Council
    - Background:
        - 16 DNC Youth Council seats were up for election
        - Open to registered Democrats age 35 and under
    - We had 3 candidates running for the seats: Ryan, Matt | NC, and Sterling
    - As a CTA we had an email-writing campaign to ~40–50 DNC insiders who were basically the voters for the seats
	- Candidates flew in, attended meetings, and made their case in person
    - Our guys didn't win but we still view it as a success because they did a lot of meaningful networking and built a lot of connections
		- Also coincidentally, one of the candidates who won is someone Ryan already knows personally so there's a potential line of communication there

## 🧭 Server Basics 

We also went over server basics for all the new members. This server is ultimately what you make of it, whether you have limited time or want to be deeply involved.

- If you’re busy:
    - The easiest way to contribute is completing our weekly CTA (Call to Action)
    - These are posted and pinged every Sunday
- If you want to do more, there are several teams you can join:
    - **Dev Team** which has various subteams for different projects in development
        - Pragmatic Papers website
        - Digital Ground Game website
        - Discord bot
        - Volunteer management software
        - DevOps / CI/CD
    - **Media Team** to generate art/copy to disseminate talking points online as well as to bolster our branding
    - **Moderation Team** to keep the server healthy and productive by making sure no one is acting out of line within the discord server
    - **Events Team** to create events both within and outside the server for building community
    - **Research Team** to research CTAs we can do as well as investigate political candidates/races to invest our time in
- If you’re interested in joining a team, just post in the respective team channels
- There's also the recently launched **Onboarding Team** led by Ky.
    - They're working on a standardized onboarding experience for new members
- Ryan is also currently recruiting to create an **Outreach Team**
    - They're going to be focused on outreach to officials, intellectuals, politicians and other notable figures to get on Destiny's show/stream/podcast like in Destiny's interview with Miguel Cardona, Biden's Secretary of Education

- **City Organizers**
    - We’re also actively looking for "City Organizers" in different cities
    - This role will be attached to specific cities, so for example "Seattle Organizer" or "LA Organizer" as titles. For this role you would:
        - Work with regional leads
        - Serve as point persons for when we organize specific events for their respective cities
        - Will be especially important as we ramp up toward midterm canvassing
    - If you’re in the West Region and interested, message the me (PurpleCrown) or Innami

## 📈 Time to Get Bullish on the Midterms

After Mary Peltola announced her candidacy for the Alaska Senate, the odds Democrats take back the senate in the midterms have shot up.

- What was considered nearly impossible a few years ago is now firmly within reach
- Polls show Peltola competitive and even leading in some cases

## 📅 Regular West Squad Meetings

- As an FYI for new members the west squad meets in voice chat every Thursday at 6pm
	- We alternate between agenda-focused meetings, and casual office hours without an agenda for people to just swing by and hang out
	- This week will be an agenda-focused meeting
- Also want to bring attention to Leadership Meetings that are held every Sunday at 1pm
    - They're open to all volunteers to join and listen in
    - It's a great way to stay in the loop on what different teams are working on
