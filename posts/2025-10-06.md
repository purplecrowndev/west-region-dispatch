Welcome to the first edition of our Regional Dispatch, your weekly touchpoint for everything happening in our corner of DGGPA — from local organizing and national news, to practical ways you can push back against creeping authoritarianism and keep your spirits high while doing it.

This newsletter will:
Summarize what’s happening in our region — meetings, ideas, and calls to action (CTAs).
Equip you with talking points and resources for real-world conversations.
Inspire you with small wins, positive stories, motivational quotes, and reminders that what we’re doing matters.


🗓️ Meeting Recap: First Regional Gathering

Our first Discord call was a “feel-out” session — a chance to introduce ourselves, share goals, and start shaping what this region can be.

After introductions, we had an open forum for ideas, but most of it was centered on a long debate between wanting to have a clear regional political goal along with progress metrics, vs wanting to build community engagement first. It was sort of a chicken and egg type situation (does the former produce the latter or vice versa), but eventually we agreed that we can do both at the same time and balance ambition and community. 

So going forward every week we will alternate between “professional” meetings (updates, coordination, CTAs), and casual office-hours hangouts (community time, free-form discussion, or a place where as Moto put it, he can argue that "Solo Leveling" is the worst anime ever). That means this week’s meeting will be an office-hours hangout. Come by to meet other regulars here, and talk about anything from gaming to local issues you care about.

Also we plan to post a weekly thread (or Google Form as Ky suggested, the details still need to be hammered out) for members to flag local issues — anything from bad state legislation to housing policy. Top submissions may turn into regional CTAs. 

🌤️ Some Positive Opinion Polling:

It’s easy to feel like things are spiraling, and no one seems to care, but data says otherwise. The latest CBS News/YouGov poll shows Americans are souring on much of Trump's policies.
https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-poll-shutdown-trump-democrats-republicans/

📊 Most important issues facing the country:
27% Economy and jobs
21% Inflation
15% Health care
14% Immigration
9% Crime
9% Government spending
4% Events overseas

📊 How voters rate Trump’s record on prices:
75% say he’s not doing enough
20% say just right
5% say too much

📊 Are Trump’s policies making you financially better off?
51% say worse off (was only 28% in January in the same CBS/YouGov poll)
32% about the same
17% better off (was 42% in January in the same CBS/YouGov poll)

📊 Concern About Gov't Shutdown Effect on the Economy
49% Very Concerned
31% Somewhat Concerned
20% Not Concerned

📊 Blame the Most for Government Shutdown
39% Trump & Reps in Congress
30% Dems in Congress
31% Both Equally

Why this matters:
Trump ran on "fixing" the economy which remains the top issue, and yet most voters are saying he's not doing enough in regards to prices, and a majority think his policies are making them financially worse off (was only 28% in January!). 80% of voters are at least somewhat concerned about how the government shutdown will effect the economy, and a plurality mostly blame trump and the republicans. We should help people connect these dots between what Trump said he would do, and what he's doing now. 

🧠 Some Talking Points: 
"Trump and the Republicans are letting the government shutdown because they won't budge on taking away healthcare for millions of Americans just so they can fund tax cuts for their billionaire friends."

"Trump is bailing out Argentina just because Javier Milei is his friend. What happened to America first?"

⚔️ Mission Going Forward

“The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena…” — Theodore Roosevelt

Just by joining this discord group, you've made the decision to step into the arena, and defend democracy while it's under threat. 
It may not seem like much, but just by wanting to take an active part, you are acting as a bulwark against encroaching authoritarianism.
You're setting yourself apart from all those others who are hopelessly cynical, think politics is pointless, or simply wallow in despair. 
The current administration wants nothing more than for people to fall into demoralized or apathetic passivity, and believe that nothing can be done to change things. But just know that dooming is compliance. Instead of complaining about how the information space has been captured right wing brain rot whether it be podcasts or legacy media, fight back from the ground up. Flood the zone in your own personal life. Every message, every conversation, every vote is part of that fight.

It takes courage to fight back when cynicism feels easier. But cynicism never built a future.
We’re here to remind each other that democracy isn’t a spectator sport — and that you’re not fighting alone.

Stay strong. Stay loud. Stay in the arena.
