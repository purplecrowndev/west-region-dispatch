“We stood tall and we stood firm in response to Donald Trump's recklessness. 
Tonight, after poking the bear, this bear roared.”
-Gavin Newsom after prop 50 passed in California

Hey everyone, hope you're all feeling energized because the elections this past Tuesday were a 
blowout win for democracy, with Democrats sweeping across states, counties, and cities in an 
incredible tidal wave.

This dispatch will just be a celebration of what just happened in the form of 
a bombardment of gratifying results and crazy statistics.

🌊 Good News: A Massive Blue Tsunami

California:
Voters overwhelming voted for prop 50, the redistricting reform meant to counter Trump's 
power grab in Texas. It is currently winning by a margin of 28 points.
That margin is greater than the margin Kamala had in the presidential election,
and greater than the margins Gavin Newsom got in any of his gubernatorial elections.
Results also showed eight Californian counties that Trump won in 2024 but supported 
Proposition 50 this past Tuesday: Fresno (where Trump beat Harris by a 4.38% margin), 
Merced (4.36%), Inyo (2.98%), San Bernardino (2.14%), Lake (1.37%), Riverside (1.26%), 
San Joaquin (0.89%), and Imperial (0.86%).

Virginia: 
Abigail Spanberger won in Virginia by roughly 15 points.
That's a 17 point swing from 4 years ago where Rs won by 2.
Democrats entered the night with a 51 to 49 majority in the House of Delegates.
Not only did they retain their majority, they gained 13+ seats (there is one race still 
too close to call), expanding their House of Delegates majority to at least 64 seats, 
the biggest majority since 1987. Keeping the majority also means they can push forward 
with their plans to follow California in redrawing their maps.

New Jersey:
Mikie Sherrill won in New Jersey by about 13 points.
This is about a 10 point swing from 4 years ago.
Polls shows a close race but Sherril outperformed her polls by 8 to 10 points 
Democrats also flipped 3 Assembly seats growing their 
Assembly majority from 52 to 55 seats (out of 80), 
their largest in 52 years, securing a supermajority.

New York: 
Zohran Mamdani won New York City’s mayoral race over 
Andrew Cuomo in a race that saw record turnout.
Democrats now control the Onondaga County legislature (Syracuse) 
for the first time in 50 years.

Georgia: 
Democrats flipped 2 statewide Public Service Commission seats. 
Peter Hubbard and Alicia Johnson both won with about 60 percent of the vote.
First time since 2006 that Democrats have won a non-federal statewide office in Georgia.

Pennsylvania:
Voters kept 3 Democratic Pennsylvania Supreme Court justices, defeating a multimillion-dollar 
conservative campaign run by billionaire Jeff Yass who was compared to Elon Musk.
Democrats also won 2 statewide judicial special elections for the Pennsylvania 
Superior Court and Commonwealth Court. In Bucks County, Democrats swept all top county offices, 
electing the county’s first-ever Democratic district attorney and defeating the GOP sheriff.
Democrats also won big in Erie, Lehigh, and Northampton counties — all presidential bellwethers.

Mississippi:
Democrats broke the GOP supermajority in the state Senate.
Flipped 2 Senate seats and 1 House seat after court-ordered 
redistricting expanded Black representation.

Texas:
In a district Trump won by 2024, Democrat Taylor Rehmet will be heading to a runoff election 
for the Texas SD-9 state senate seat. He faced off against "UltraMAGA" Republican 
Leigh Wambsganss, and a more run of the mill Republican John Huffman. 
No one won a majority, but Rehmet won a plurality 47.6% of the vote. He will be 
facing Wambsganss who got 36% of the vote in a runoff election.

Other local elections:
Orlando, Florida: Last GOP city-council member unseated.
Georgetown, South Carolina: Democrats flipped all three city-council seats.
Charlotte, North Carolina: First Democratic city-council pickup since 1999.
Connecticut: Democrats reclaimed several mayor’s offices.

Some other random facts:
There have been 5 times in the past 90 years that Democrats won the NYC mayoral race, 
and the New Jersey and Virginia governor races. All 5 times they went on to win the 
House in the midterms the following year. Not sure how much to take this fact as some 
sort of bellwether, but it's still cool nonetheless.

Jay Jones, the scandal ridden (text messages were discovered where he said some awful stuff) 
Democratic Attorney General candidate in Virginia who was up against a republican incumbent, 
won his race by a margin greater than Kamala did in Virginia in the presidential election. 
Obviously do not condone the text messages, but just thought that was a crazy fact.

All 21 of New Jersey's counties swung towards Democrats 
compared to their margins in the 2024 presidential election

In Union City, an 82% Hispanic City in Hudson County, New Jersey, Sherrill received more votes 
in an off year governor election than Kamala did for president last year.

In Virginia, 86 out of its 91 counties swung towards Democrats 
compared to their margins in the 2024 presidential election

In terms of the elections overall this wasn't just about Democrats turning out, 
and Republicans staying home. Much of the gains were also made on persuasion.
Spanberger and Sherrill each won 7 percent of Trump’s 2024 supporters according to exit polls.
In particular, Sherrill won back 18 percent of Trump’s 2024 Hispanic vote in New Jersey.

🕯️ Final Thought
Moments like this remind us how great it can feel when we fight back and take a stand.
Democracy isn’t an accident. It’s built by people who show up and keep showing up.
So bask in all the good vibes, but don't get complacent. We're only getting started.
