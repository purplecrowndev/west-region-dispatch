Keeping this short but this dispatch is mostly about following through on my New Year’s resolution CTA to finally start this newsletter back up.

Due to some technical hiccups on github, this isn’t as long as I originally planned, but I still wanted to get something out to build consistency. Don't let perfect be the enemy of the good as they say. And as I also like to argue, progress is progress, even if it's incremental! 

🗂️ Last Meeting Recap

At our last meeting, we:
- Welcomed a lot of new faces
- Did a 2025 year-in-review
- Walked through the basics of the server to help newer members get oriented
- Shared our intentions for the region this year

I'll do a more in depth summary in a longer edition later this week, but genuinely excited by the influx of all the new people, not just in this region but across the server. You can definitely feel the positive energy across the different teams as well.
