“Do what you can, with what you have, where you are.” — Theodore Roosevelt

Welcome back to the Regional Dispatch, your weekly snapshot of what’s happening with our regional squad, along with motivational quotes, news to celebrate, and talking points to use with your friends and family.

🗓️ First Office Hours

Last Thursday was our first Office Hours! They’re supposed to be casual and fun hangouts for community building, and will take place every other week (when we don’t have our regular regional meeting). 
To illustrate the casual aspect of it, this is a recap:
  • We discussed weird quirks and features of different languages.
  • Dark humor talking about plausible countries we could go to if we were somehow deported.
  • Why Washington State is supposedly the best state in the US with its mountains, forests, coastlines, and nature in general. I personally am not in agreement.
  • Towards the end there was also some more brainstorming, akin to previous week’s more serious meeting, about other things we can do to get community engagement (webinars to teach practical skills like personal finance, office hours with a specific fun topic to discuss, live event watch parties, etc)

🚨 Call to Action: Attend the "No Kings" Protest — October 18

This is the general CTA for the whole server this week. Some of you have already met up to go to see Destiny debate people in your city last week, so we highly encourage threads starting up again for meetup logistics to connect again to go to one of these protests. 

🌤️ Good News: California YIMBYs Creating Positive Change
Governor Gavin Newsom signed SB 79 into law on October 10th — a landmark upzoning bill that will reshape housing policy in California for decades.

In plain terms:SB 79 is a massive step toward fixing the housing crisis by allowing dramatically more mid-rise multifamily buildings to be built in transit areas previously restricted by outdated zoning rules. More apartments, duplexes, and infill development combined with less red tape as well as greater enforcement mechanisms for cities that do not comply.

Why it matters:California has long been the poster child for progressive ideals but also an embarrassment when it comes to housing affordability. For a state that prides itself on being forward-thinking, that contradiction has been glaring. This law is an actual step toward solving the housing affordability crisis rather than empty gestures acknowledging the issue without making any real actions towards solving it.

Personal Opinion:California being so unaffordable for most people really hurts the brand of Democrats nationwide. I believe that California should be leading the way in terms of having policies and laws that truly makes life better for every day people, because I think it’ll be one step towards shifting the national conversation (undercutting a major right wing talking point about dysfunction in out of touch blue states), and helping to repair the national Democratic brand.

📺 Content Spotlight: MoistCr1TiKaL vs. MAGA Brainwashing
It’s rare to see a major non political YouTuber tear into MAGA corruption and insanity as bluntly as MoistCr1TiKaL (penguinz0) just did. His new video — “MAGA Brainwashing is Out of Control” — is a full-on rant about Trump-world’s corruption and cult-like thinking. The video is a great thing to share with anyone you know who doesn’t really follow politics too closely.
A few highlights worth knowing (and sharing as talking points to friends and family):

💸 The $190 Million Crypto TradeSomeone started shorting Bitcoin and Ethereum one day before Trump’s Truth Social post announcing 100% tariffs on China — a move that tanked markets worldwide, including crypto. The trader increased shorts up, even after Trump’s initial more vague post threatening China, all the way until one minute before the second more concrete Trump post announcing 100% the tariffs, then cashed out 30 minutes later for a $190 million profit. Meanwhile others without this insider knowledge had untold amounts of wealth liquidated, with some even going as far as to commit suicide afterwards. It’s such a blatant example of insider corruption that comes at the expense of everyone else.

✈️ The Qatar DealTrump reportedly accepted a $400M private jet from Qatar, then turned around and approved a $5.5B golf course deal and a Qatari Air Force base in Idaho. Just shows that it’s always been Trump and his cronies first, rather than “America First.”

🤡 The FBI ClaimTrump recently claimed that Biden’s FBI planted 274 agents in the January 6th mob — despite Trump himself being president at the time. It’s such a ridiculous claim that even Charlie can’t help laughing mid-rant.

🕯️ Final Thought

Authoritarian movements feed on apathy, so we have to refuse to look away. Do what you can to let others in your life realize the insanity that is going on. Every democratic renewal starts with ordinary people deciding that doing nothing isn’t an option. Stay engaged. Stay loud. Stay principled. See you at the protest.
