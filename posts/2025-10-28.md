🗓️ Office Hours Recap

Last week's office hours was a lot of fun with several new faces, great energy, and some 
promising ideas for building out the West Coast Region. The ideas came from a discussion 
on how to create enthusiasm and turn it into structure so people can feel part of a 
growing movement that has a clear direction.

Some ideas from our brainstorming:

🏙️ Create a West Coast Roadmap:
Draft a document outlining what we want to accomplish as a region to provide a vision for the 
future to rally around.

🍻 Establish “3rd Place” Meeting Spots:
We want cities in our region to have a casual go-to gathering place that meets on the regular.
A place to see friendly faces, as well as discuss DGGP projects/initiatives. 
Could be a favorite local bar, café, or community space. 
Over time, these could even become DGGP-affiliated hangouts if enough members frequent them.

🤝 Baseline Volunteer Activities:
Establish recurring volunteer opportunities in each city, like monthly foodbank shifts, 
which also serve as social events.

🌲 West Coast Summit (Proof of Concept):
Long-term goal: host a West Coast Summit that can act as a model for a future DGGP-wide summit.
Imagine bringing together local leaders, members, and creators for panels, workshops, 
and maybe a few drinks after.

⚔️ Call to Action: Volunteer or Phonebank

This week’s CTA is a two-parter:

Volunteer at a local foodbank, or

Join the Prop 50 phonebanking event this Thursday at 5pm.

🕕 Note: this will replace our regular regional meeting since it happens at the same time. 
We highly encourage everyone to jump in as prop 50 is extremely important at the federal level.

🗣️ Leadership Update

From Sunday’s leadership meeting:
We’re working to integrate more closely with the broader Destiny community across Reddit, 
Discord, and DGG chat (which apparently is its own thing separate from Destiny's discord). 

More CTAs and events will be promoted across those forums to bring in new members.
This week’s CTA was posted on Reddit and looks like it gained a lot of traction!

If you’re active in any of those spaces, mention DGGP when you can. 
Be part of the visibility push. Flood the zone. 
There are still tons of Destiny watchers who don’t know who we are so let’s fix that.

Far down the road we want to create DGGP chapters in every state!

🧠 Argument of the Week: Trump Still Acts Like a King

Trump tore down the East Wing of the White House to build his personal ballroom,
a $300 million vanity project, after promising publicly that the ballroom would 
not affect the historic building.

He claims donors are covering costs out of the goodness of their hearts, but those "donors" 
include Microsoft, Coinbase, Palantir, Lockheed Martin, Amazon, and Google. 
These are corporations with direct stakes in government policy 
and they no doubt are going to want something. 
This is basically pay-to-play: fundraising by selling access to the White House. 

Right-wing media has been dismissing any outrage by citing Obama’s basketball court renovation. 
This is a false equivalency as that didn’t destroy the East Wing, and it was part of a broader 
renovation project that had bipartisan congressional approval under Bush. 
Trump’s ballroom renovation is unilateral, self-serving, and historically destructive.

📅 Upcoming Server-Wide Events

While we want to build the community within our region, we also want to do so for all of DGGP.
With that in mind highlighting these upcoming events:

🎙️ Friday, Oct 31 – Debate Night (5 PM)
🕹️ Saturday, Nov 1 – Saturday Night Jackbox (6 PM)
🎬 Saturday, Nov 1 – Movie Night: The West Wing Series (7 PM)

These events are great chances to relax and connect with members across regions.

🕯️ Final Thought

There are some ambitious ideas here, but we have to start taking that inspiration and putting 
it into structure as soon as possible. The first step to getting there is to develop a regular
cadence and have people meet one another. So on that note we're going to try and have more 
in person events so be on the lookout!
